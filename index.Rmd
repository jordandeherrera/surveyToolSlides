## Survey Tool Overview

The SurveyTool is designed to be an interactive survey that not only records survey respondent answers, but also provides live feedback and benchmarked results to the respondent once they are finished taking the survey:

1. The survey respondents are incentivized to take the survey as they are only able to see their benchmarked and overall results once they have completed the survey
2. The survey results are validated through automatically generated validation codes from R script.
3. Survey respondents can optionally enter in their e-mail at the end of the survey and the e-mail is recorded if the respondent would like more information.  The intention is to create something that is of value to the respondent, build a database of the overall landscape and competencies in the industry, and also create a marketing tool where respondents voluntarily give their contact information.

## Instructions

The survey's instructions are located on the same page as the landing page for the survey.  The landing page and description of how to take the survey also includes a simple white paper as an attachment and downloadable link in the www directory so that the survey respondent can learn a little bit more about the company.

## Random Validation

The survey tool uses the random package to generate random validation codes for each respondent.  Below is an example of how this script works within the tool.

If you'd like to see for yourself though, the survey is located at:  [SurveyTool](http://www.verasite.net/coursera)

```{r}
library(random)
x <- 1
Validation.Code <- data.frame(Code = randomStrings(n=x, len=5), Count = rep(0,x), 
                              Name = rep("John Smith",x), Title = rep("Analyst",x), 
                              Organization = rep("Acme",x), ResponseNo = rep(0,x))
colnames(Validation.Code) <- c("Code","Count","Name","Title","Organization", "ResponseNo")
Validation.Code
```
